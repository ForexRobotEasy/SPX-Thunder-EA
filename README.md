## Code Description

The provided code is a template for a trading robot using the SPX Thunder EA strategy. It includes necessary libraries such as Trade, MovingAverages, and Indicators. The code defines constants for the trading symbol and timeframe.

Trading parameters such as risk percentage, stop loss percentage, and take profit percentage are defined as inputs.

The code also includes five different trading strategies (strategy1 to strategy5) that can be implemented based on specific criteria.

The `OnInit` function is responsible for setting up trading parameters and strategies. In this function, the expert magic number and deviation in points are set using the Trade library. Additionally, the MovingAverages indicator is initialized with specific parameters.

The `OnTick` function is executed on every tick and is responsible for checking entry and exit criteria based on the defined trading strategies. It also handles placing and managing orders.

The code includes error handling with the `OnTradeError` function, trade event handling with the `OnTrade` function, and chart event handling with the `OnChartEvent` function. These functions can be customized to update trade information and perform chart analysis.

The `OnTester` function is used for performing backtesting, including Monte Carlo stress validation and historical data analysis.

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the EA is removed from the chart or the platform is closed. It can be used for cleaning up any open trades or orders.
